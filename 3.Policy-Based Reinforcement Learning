Review: Policy function approximation:
func: pai(a|s), state s is an input

Policy network: pai(a|s,theta);Use a neural net to approximate pai(a|s);
theta: trainable parameters of the neural net.

Sum of pai(a|s,theta) = 1. Because this is a probability dense function.

Definition:Approximate state - value function:
V(s;theta) = sum of pai(a|s;theta) * Q(s,a).
Policy based learing: **learn that maximizes J(theta) = Es[V(s;theta)];**
